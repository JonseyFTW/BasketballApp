# Basketball Animation System - Status Report

## ✅ Phase 2 Implementation Complete

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Progress Component Dependency Error** - ✅ RESOLVED
   - Replaced `@radix-ui/react-progress` dependency with custom HTML/CSS implementation
   - No more module resolution errors
   - Component now works without external dependencies

2. **Three.js Version Compatibility** - ✅ RESOLVED 
   - Updated to Three.js v0.169.0 with compatible React Three Fiber
   - All dependencies properly installed and compatible

3. **Canvas Spacing Issues** - ✅ RESOLVED
   - Fixed responsive sizing with ResizeObserver
   - No more court bleeding over borders

### Current System Status:
- ✅ 2D Animation Engine (AnimationEngine.tsx)
- ✅ 3D Visualization System (Animation3D.tsx) 
- ✅ Video Export Functionality (VideoExporter.tsx)
- ✅ Advanced Study Tools (AnimationStudyTools.tsx)
- ✅ Animation Controls & Player (AnimationPlayer.tsx)
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Docker container running without errors

### Authentication Issue:
- User reports needing to refresh page on first load for login to work
- This is likely a NextAuth session hydration issue
- Suggestion: Check if session is being properly initialized on first load

### How to Test:
1. Navigate to any play page
2. Click "Animate" button
3. Toggle between 2D and 3D views
4. Test video export functionality
5. Use study tools (bookmarks, annotations, analysis)

### Next Steps if Issues Persist:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check browser console for any remaining JavaScript errors
3. Verify database connections are working
4. Test with different browsers

The animation system should now be fully functional with all Phase 2 features working correctly.
